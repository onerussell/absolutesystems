Profile Page Fields 

These are the fields that I want to be on the individual's profile page. 
That is, the student enters them when they set up their profile and they 
are on the main part of the page when the profile is viewed.

The following information should go to the right of the photo.

Quote: 
Age: 
Abroad Status: (Students choose from a menu) Just Researching, Coming Soon, Currently Abroad, Returnee 
About Me: 
Best Travel Story:

(Below these fields should be the user's first 6 friends) 
(Below that should be the user's comments space just like on myspace)

The following information should go below the Send A Message, Give a Kiss, Make Friends, and 
Read Blog links:

As far as when the student creates his/her profile, you can organize these fields however you want.
It only matters to me that the student fills in the fields of his/her choice, and whatever is not 
filled in does not show up on his/her profile page. For example, say they leave "Travel Advice" 
blank, I do not want a bullet that says "Travel Advice" and a bunch of blank space. You know?
