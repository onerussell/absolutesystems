The actual Bar or Disco reviews should look something like this, but the bars and clubs/discos need their own sections:

Bar Disco Name: La Oveja Negra
Address: 1234 Calle Rambla, Barcelona
Price: (students choose from menu) Expensive, Fair, Cheap
Scene: (Students choose from menu) Laid Back, Friendly, Dressed To Impress, Fancy, Meat Market, Modern, Gay/Lesbian
Music: (Students choose from a menu) House/Electronic, Hip Hop, Latin, A Good Mix of Dance Tunes, 
		Random American Oldies, Live Music

The above information should only be posted the first time a review is added by a student. 
The reviews below should look like the comments page on the student's profile page. 
Each review should link to the person's profile who wrote the review.

Review: (This is where students write their own personal review, 
like "La Oveja Negra is such a meat market! The music is great but 
the guys are so aggressive! Hit on the older looking dudes. They're 
likely to have money and get you into the VIP Room!"

Rank: (Students choose from a menu) 1-5 frogs. You can use the same frog faces that are on 
the home page. Get it? Instead of 1-5 stars they'll be 1-5 frogs. 

After all the comments posted on the particular bar, there should be a link to Add A Comment, 
where a student can post her own review on that same bar.
